Abacus Market is a smaller darknet market that is slightly over a year old. Struggling to find a consistent user base, the market rebranded from ‘Alphabet’ in October 2021 to avoid being confused with the recently ‘re-launched’ AlphaBay. The market picked up some vendors after the closure of White House Market but in general suffers from a severe lack of diversity in terms of vendors and products. Most of the digital items offered at Abacus can be found on any other market, and about half of the subcategories for Drugs & Chemicals are empty.

The market’s admins claim to have coded it from scratch, but this has more or less been debunked. The layout of Abacus looks familiar to people in the scene of darknet marketplaces, that’s because a lot of the UI is speculated to have been taken directly from AlphaBay (which has been the subject of many imitators since its inception). This includes the menu option elements, listing and vendor pages, as well as categories and listings layouts. On one hand, it shows a lack of originality on the part of the market’s creators; on the other hand, this layout is highly intuitive and well known amongst pre-existing vendors who might be attracted to the user base making it's ease of use a big appeal.

Abacus Market is home to about 2,800 listings, most of which are found in the fraud category with the second majority revolving around hacked accounts for various services including online banking and pornography websites. Other categories hosted include Drugs & Chemicals, Counterfeit Items, Digital Products, Guides & Tutorials, Jewels & Gold, Carded Items, Software & Malware, Security & Hosting, Other Listings. As listings on Abacus are rather sparse, some categories are entirely empty. The Drugs category is meticulously divided into over two dozen subcategories, making it easy for users to locate specific products, the amount of care put into dividing these up makes sense, the majority of revenue generated for the administrators comes from the appeal to anonymously purchase substances. Abacus also possesses the usual search and filter options that comes with this market template.

Abacus Market supports both Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) two dominating cryptocurrencies used for illicit trades online due to their appeal for anonymity. While it does use the traditional account wallet system (You must first top up your account balance before making a purchase), they do support Multi-signature 2/3 payments – an option employed by some security conscious vendors. When users purchase products their funds are held in escrow allowing an admin to manually review user disputes and decide to return a victim of vendor exit scamming their funds. Vendors with a significant amount of completed sales however are afforded FE (finalize early) privileges allowing them to completely bypass this escrow system. One of the interesting things about Abacus is that the amount to be FE’d is adjusted by percent (from 25% to 100%) based on the rank of the vendor.

The listings sold on Abacus are widely outlawed across the world, that doesn’t mean Abacus is doesn't follow a strict code of ethics and rules. In fact, they have a very strict code of conduct that users widely agree with "our rules are based in treating other as you would like to be treated" They actively ban scammers and look down upon people who don't mind their own business or prod for information. In the spirit of those rules, there are some things you will never see sold, and they actively let users know  that their reports submitted are carefully and manually reviewed. They do not allow child pornography or any resources that might lead to, selling humans or their parts, services to harm other (physical or mental including assassination, threatening, arson, surveillance, harassment etc), fentanyl or analogues, poisons, selling guns, explosives or any items which may lead to any terroristic actions (some exceptions are tasers, pepper sprays), just to name a few.
